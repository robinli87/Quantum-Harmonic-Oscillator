# Quantum-Harmonic-Oscillator
Solves for the stationary wavefunction of a quantum particle trapped in a quadratic potential well, using Numerov's Method and the analytical method with Hermite Polynomials, then compare them against each other. 
Euler's solution is plotted as greem; Numerov is red and Hermite Polynomials (the correct solution) is blue. 
Can be modified to solve for different potentials, e.g. Lenard-Jones using Numerov's method.
